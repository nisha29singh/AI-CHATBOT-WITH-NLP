# Description :
This project implements a simple rule-based AI chatbot using Natural Language Processing (NLP) capabilities provided by the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) library in Python. The chatbot is designed to interact with users through predefined patterns and responses related to AI concepts, providing basic conversational capabilities.
Key Features:
1. NLP with Pattern Matching
The chatbot uses regular expressions to detect and match user input against a set of predefined patterns. Each pattern has associated responses that are selected randomly for variability.
2. NLTK's Chat Module
Chat: Provides the logic to handle conversation flow.
reflections: A dictionary for basic pronoun transformations (e.g., “I am” → “you are”), helping the chatbot sound more natural.
3.Topics the Chatbot Can Discuss:
Artificial Intelligence (AI)
Machine Learning (ML)
Deep Learning
General greetings and basic questions about the bot
